Rogue Wars-

Rogue Wars is an WIP game by an independant developer (me). I love roguelike games and I don't see many PVP Roguelikes in the scene, so I thought I'd combine a bullet hell, roguelike, and PVP into one game.

Current Status:

Physics Framework |   Done (Requires Polishing),

Collisions        |   Done (Volume Collisions Still Required)

Roadmap: (More things to be added)

Gameplay:
Weight / Stopping Power Physics,
Enemy AI

User Interface:
Health,
Taskbar,
Command Bar,
Options

Graphics:
Animations        |   Work and Progress (See assets),

Pixel Art         |   Work and Progress (See assets)
